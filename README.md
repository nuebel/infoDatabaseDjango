# Student Information Database (Python/Django Version)
## Created by: [Nic Uebel](http://github.com/nuebel)

### About
This is a rewrite of my [PHP student information database](https://github.com/nuebel/infoDatabase) using Python and Django.

### Project Requirements
* Store contact information for individual students, including name, email, phone, local/dorm address, home address, class, major, etc.
* Ability to create, edit, and delete student records.
* Functionality for tracking students in family groups. These are small groups that meet weekly and are named by color. This includes tracking attendance for each small group meeting.
* Sort information by name, class, family group, and local address.
* Search for students by any field.
* Create PDFs (for printing) of any subset of students.
* Create PDF mailing labels for printing out mass mailings to parents of students.
* Create a list of all students that can be used to update the organization's email LISTSERV.
* Maintain separate databases for each school year. Be able to switch between databases.
* Use a user/pw login to prevent student contact information from being publicly available.
